# Brooks Rules

Fred Brooks is, among other things, author of [The Mythical Man Month](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month), a classic book on software development.  The chapters of that book are sprinkled with "rules." Most of the rules are general enough to stand on their own, though some make no sense outside the context of the chapter.

Brooks Rules is a list of all the rules, in json format. 

Enjoy!
